hello i am jane smith 
hi jane 
i understand you were thinking about applying for admission to our university 
yes 
your school has a wonderful education department 
and i am very interested in teaching 
well it is very good to be thinking about the future 
have you thought about what age level students you were interested in teaching 
i have 
but that is what it poses some of other problem for me 
i really have enjoyed my high school english and literature classes 
but i also really like working with little kids 
i certainly understand your dilemma 
but it really need not be a problem for you at this point 
well why is that 
i thought i would need to know exactly what i wanted to study 
when i applied for college 
well some students do and others do not 
most students have a general idea before they enroll 
but not all students stay on the educational path they started out on 
what most students do not realize is that all first year or freshman college students <now> will be taking what we call core classes 
hi rob how are you today hello li i am really angry why well because i work very hard i get results i do much more than i really should and nobody notices i don t get any recognition yes you do work hard rob you should earn a fortune i know you see that is it i am going to go and see the boss right now i am going to ask for a pay rise good on you rob right now yes right now 
Ellis                 this  is Now  our new flatmate he is really missing his frames now let me take your now   of that so where are you from now from now      the polish capital now what do you   do i am  a guide tourist now so  interesting why are you visiting london now to improve my english now why not come out with us now then we can show you up and you can practice your english at the same time 
hi can i help you 
yes i would like to buy a washing machine 
okay which brand would you like 
i do not care so much about brands 
so what are you looking for 
i am looking for good price and good functions 
okay function and price are important to you 
that is right 
okay first may i ask you what size washer do you need 
what do you mean by what size washer 
well like a small sizes is four kilos large size is eight kilos 
do you have a medium size 
sure medium size is six kilos 
okay i think i want medium size 
alright and do you want a one bin or a two bin washer 
what is the difference between one bin and two bin 
well with the two bin washer you have to move the clothes to the spinner yourself 
and the one bin 
it does it automatically it is a two in one spin bin 
i understand which one cleans better 
they clean the same 
really and do the washers cost the same 
well the one bin washer is more expensive but it is simple to use 
simple is important well i think i would like the one bin washer 
you know if you like things simple and easy may i suggest to you the fuzzy logic function 
what is the fuzzy logic 
fuzzy logic is a special function it makes using the washer easier 
how does the function work 
well you put in your clothes you put in the soap and the washer does the rest 
sounds perfect this is exactly the kind of washing machine i have been looking for 
you sparrow aye you are familiar with that ship the black pearl i ve heard of it where does it make berth where does it make berth 
have you not heard the stories 
captain barbossa and his crew of miscreants sail from the dreaded isla of de muerta 
well if you are intending to brave all hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady s heart 
you ll have to do it alone mate 
i see no profit in it for me i can get you out of there how s that the key s run off i helped build these cells these are half pin barrel hinges with the right leverage and the proper application of strength the door will lift free 
what s your name 
will turner 
that would be short for william i imagine good strong name 
no doubt named for your father right 
yes 
alright i am moving my infantry division 
augmented by a battalion of orcs from lord of the rings 
we flank the tennessee volunteers and the north once again wins the battle of gettysburg 
not so fast remember the south still has two infantry divisions plus superman and godzilla 
no no no no orcs are magic superman is vulnerable to magic not to mention you already lost godzilla to the illinois cavalry and hulk 
why do not you just have robert e lee charge the line with shiva and ganesh 
hi you guys ready to order 
hang on honey 
shiva and ganesh the hindu gods against the entire union army 
and orcs 
i will be back 
excuse me ganesh is the remover of obstacles and shiva is the destroyer 
when the smoke clears abraham lincoln will be speaking hindi and drinking mint juleps 
alright my boss says you to either have to order or leave and never come back 
what do you recommend for someone who worked up a man sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio funk 
a shower 
i will take the heart smart platter 
alright thank you and sheldon 
we do not eat here i do not know what s good 
well it is all good 
statistically unlikely 
just get a hamburger you like hamburgers 
i like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers you can not make the assumption that i will like the hamburgers here 
i am sorry 
give him a hamburger 
<now> which one the classic burger the ranch house burger the barbecue burger or the kobe burger 
can not we just go to big boy 
they only have one burger the 
the big boy 
the barbecue burger is like the big boy 
<now> excuse me in a world that already includes a big boy why would i settle for something like a big boy 
because you are not at big boy 
fine i will have the barbecue burger 
make it two 
waitresses do not yell at you at big boy 
hey leonard 
hi guys 
<now> hey leslie 
i did not know you ate here 
we do not this is a disturbing aberration 
leslie <now> this is penny she lives across the hall from sheldon and me 
and walks in quiet beauty like the night 
howard i have asked you not to do that 
leslie and i do research together at the university 
<now> 
wow a girl scientist 
yep come for the breasts stay for the brains 
so i am glad i ran into you the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist 
what happened to elliot wong 
he switched over to high energy radiation research had a little mishap and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him 
so are you in 
yeah sure why not 
great we rehearse on tuesdays at your place 
why at my place 
yeah department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone 
nice meeting you 
yeah you too 
leonard 
i did not know you played the cello 
yeah my parents felt that naming me leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes was not getting me beaten up enough 
if you are into music i happen to be a human beat box 
really 
i am actually not that into music 
so hey your friend is really cute anything going on with you two 
leslie 
no no what are you kidding 
he asked her out once it was an embarrassing failure 
thank you sheldon 
<now> i am sorry was that supposed to be a secret 
<now> that is too bad you guys would make a cute couple 
oh dear 
what is the matter 
she did not take my order 
how can she take your order when you are too neurotic to talk to her 
nevertheless 
this will be reflected in her tip 
well mr turner i ve changed my mind if  you spring me from this cell i swear on pain of death i shall take you to the black pearl and your bonny lass do we have an accord 
agreed agreed get me out 
hi er can you help me 
sure what s the problem 
i ve got to write an essay on electrical distribution and transmission systems but i can t find any suitable books in the engineering section on level three 
have you used the library search engine 
you mean where you type the keywords into the computer yes i ve done that a couple of books come up but they re not on the shelves someone s taken them out 
well i can put a reserve on them so that when the person brings them back to the library 
we can put them on one side for you 
do you want to do that 
mmm 
i don t know i 
 i suppose so but ideally i d like to get started on my essay sooner rather than later 
well there are some other options have 
have  you used the journal database 
no what s that 
didn t you go on a library induction tour in the first week of term they were running five days a week morning and afternoon 
no i was er i was ill that week 
well we still do two library inductions a week on wednesdays and i recommend you go on one of them 
you ll learn a lot of useful things you can sign up at the desk on level two 
yes i probably should do that then 
well i ll just quickly show you how you can use the journal database 
if you go onto the library homepage  on the computer look 
look and  click on databases here in the top right hand corner it 
it takes you to all the e journals that we have access to here at the university library 
you can use the search engine to find journals that are related to your keywords 
see  if i type in electrical transmission you get over five thousand articles  
wow 
so that s a good place to start  meanwhile you can always go and talk to your subject librarian 
the person for electrical engineering is mark taylor 
his office is on level four 
will he be there now 
let me see what s the time 
twelve  fifteen heopen ll probably be on lunch or if not he ll be going at twelve thirty 
you d be best to wait and come back at two ish then you ll be more likely to catch him 
okay thank you 
this is my friend 
karl pilkington 
he is bald 
he is bald 
he has no hair 
karl pilkington 
has no hair i know they can see i ve got no hair no no 
well what do they need to know that for if they re learning a language 
bald isn t a bald a bald head isn t 
isn t that important 
teach them how to ask for bread or milk 
we ll get to that 
but this is about 
so 
friendship 
and family 
you know 
so 
it s all useful 
there s so many words you know they might as well start somewhere 
there s too many words 
a lot of words 
lots of words 
so you say it 
karl pilkington is bald 
karl pilkington 
has got a head like a fucking orange i really don t know why they need to learn this 
because they might need to say that one day but i get enough abuse now from English people i don t want Chinese suddenly turning up going bald fucking orange <now> teach them how to say milk i need milk milk for tea 
coffee 
teach me useful stuff ok we ll teach them something then 
who am i talking to 
people around the world they can t speak English yet 
so what do they i ve been to China and none of them know English 
right 
so they need to learn English 
ok so <now> 
what would they want to know 
you see they don t need to know about milk because they don t like milk 
they think english people smell of milk 
they smell 
of milk <now> 
smell 
what does smell mean karl 
smell 
<now> stink 
fucking hell you smell 
<now> rank 
rank 
rank so you ve got a chinese fella 
he s coming over here and he s learned the word 
rank meaning you stink 
smell 
stank stunk 
<now> that stunk <now> give an example 
<now> 
you smell 
you shit 
<now> why are you teaching them pidgin English because she told me you said they want to know about smell 
yeah right 
but why are you teaching them without prepositions and proper why are you teaching them to speak like this 
<now> 
stink you shit 
why are you teaching them 
to speak <now> just speak 
proper English right ok then <now> always speak proper English 
ok tell them 
<now> so what what do they want to know what what what smell mean this is ok smell so we re featuring the word smell smell 
this is about the word smell 
right when something smells they know what it means 
<now> when something 
stinks when it s off it doesn t always mean that cause it is also a verb alright a nice smell it s also a verb to smell 
it s a verb 
smell is a verb 
yes but what they ve got to remember is if they go up to someone 
and go you smell 
it s not always positive 
you would <now> you you d say you smell nice 
right but if you say you smell 
you ll get a smacknowledge in the face 
smacknowledge in the face 
smacknowledge in the face 
karl 
what s a smacknowledge in the face 
when someone thumps you thump <now> the worst english lesson ever right ok up to you <now> ok 
but what they want to like you see that s how we are focus on are we focussing on Chinese no 
well we should because 
different people want different things right 
so what would the Chinese want they come to England 
right what do they want 
why are you talking to me like I can t understand English now because I m trying to think how <now> to be clear to them 
ok 
so dropping out so forget where they come from 
wherever they re from of the world 
they all want the same things 
no but but words don t mean the same thing in certain places ther s people where it stinks in the world 
they wouldn t come to England and need to say it smells cause they re from a smellier place 
no they re not yes they are 
<now> milk let s do milk ok 
let s do milk for anyone who isn t English 
ok ok all all them ok 
we will act out 
a scenario now where you might need milk 
ok 
ok

I know exactly where your body is 
what I 'm looking for is some indication of a brain 
too much football without a helmet <now> lyndons line on gerry ford 
deputy debriefer paris peace talks sixty eight 
snagged the silver star and a silver bar 
threw me into g two 
g two 
intelligence 
of which you have none <now> where you from <now> gresham oregon <now> colonel 
what does your daddy do in gresham oregon <now> count wood chips <now> my stepfather 
and my mom run a 
convenience store 
how are convenient 
what time they open 
five a.m. 
close 
one a.m. 
hard workers 
but you were insincere bob in a much greater sense 
if we re nothing but functions here then then why don t they just send robots 
they don t send robots bob for the simple reason they haven t invented one yet 
the day comes when they can build a robot to do what we do and make it work 
then that s exactly what they ll do precisely 
but until that day 
they send us they say hey bob 
larry phil 
why don t you go on down to wichita for a couple of days 
don t worry about your room and board we ll take care of that 
and for a couple of days bob 
we lose our identities 
here in wichita 
and we become 
the hands of the company 
shaking all the other hands 
before us what you did the reason you were insincere 
is that you cut off that bond 
it would be like the hand just sort of 
breaking away from the arm and saying oh you know what i have this other thing out here to do that has nothing to do with you 
the apostle paul said please don t do that please don t do that i m trying to have conversation with you don t bring the apostle paul in i m trying to do something else i don t see how we can have a conversation like this if i m not allowed to bring up the subject of god 
we re not talking about god i m talking about something bigger than god 
bigger than god at issue bob is not your belief in god or your desire to spread that belief 
at issue is what we re here to do which is what larry which is what 
we re here to sell lubricants bob 
industrial lubricants 
we re not here to save souls 
hey do you like this classroom 
yeah its small clean and new i also like my classmates and my teacher 
i agree but i would like to have more than one teacher because i learn better that way 
so do i i dont like having assigned seats either 
i agree i dont think the teacher should assign seats to students because i like to sit with my friends 
me too i do like the classroom though 
yeah its small and pretty relaxed i like the layout too 
the layout is okay i think itd be better if all the desks faced forward and the teachers desk was at the front and corner facing the students 
well thats easier to do when there are less students 
yeah i like classrooms with few students because i feel like i learn better 
me too so what bothers you about the classroom 
well sometimes it is too hot 
i also dont like the desks they are uncomfortable 
i dont like the homework or classwork when it is too hard and i dont like the chalkboard because it is too small 
yeah if i could i would get a bigger chalkboard 
and id get some more comfortable desks 
what would make them more comfortable 
well the desks would be movable so we could sit where we wanted and they wouldnt be attached to the chairs 
if i could improve the classroom i would also make the air conditioning system better 
i think we should get more breaks from studying we spend way too much time in here 
agreed were in here at least 6 hours every day 
i wish we changed classrooms more often because i get bored easily what do you do to pass the time 
when i get bored i stare out the window for hours 
even though i get bored i still think the classroom is a good place to study because it is usually quiet 
i think its too quiet at least it is where i sit 
you sit in the front dont you you sit with all the smart kids 
yeah you sit closer to the back correct 
i do i like where i sit because i sit next to the window and the students that sit around me are nice 
even though youre in the back theyre still pretty smart and they pay attention 
we should probably pay more attention 
yeah class isnt that bad 
i agree lets go 
welcome welcome what do you think finn well feifei there are so many skyscrapers lots of tall buildings impressive arent they absolutely look at that one its gigantic oh the jin mao tower yes its pretty gigantic and this one is really enormous yes it is the oriental pearl tower is enormous and this one is absolutely ginormous gi what finn you just made that word up 
no seriously ginormous is a word it is very informal and means well gigantic 
and enormous kind of a combination of both 
gigantic 
enormous 
ginormous 
and you re right the world financial center is ginormous can we go to the top of the tower sure
