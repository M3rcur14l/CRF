you can t request who s doing tour sack your crack or your back there s a woman in the back who does your crack 
well 
this is fuckin insane right that s enough 
no <now> i don t know who s going to learn anything from this wait 
hi er can you help me 
sure what s the problem 
i ve got to write an essay on electrical distribution and transmission systems but i can t find any suitable books in the engineering section on level three 
have you used the library search engine 
you mean where you type the keywords into the computer yes i ve done that a couple of books come up but they re not on the shelves someone s taken them out 
well i can put a reserve on them so that when the person brings them back to the library 
we can put them on one side for you 
do you want to do that 
mmm 
i don t know i 
 i suppose so but ideally i d like to get started on my essay sooner rather than later 
well there are some other options have 
have  you used the journal database 
no what s that 
didn t you go on a library induction tour in the first week of term they were running five days a week morning and afternoon 
no i was er i was ill that week 
well we still do two library inductions a week on wednesdays and i recommend you go on one of them 
you ll learn a lot of useful things you can sign up at the desk on level two 
yes i probably should do that then 
well i ll just quickly show you how you can use the journal database 
if you go onto the library homepage  on the computer look 
look and  click on databases here in the top right hand corner it 
it takes you to all the e journals that we have access to here at the university library 
you can use the search engine to find journals that are related to your keywords 
see  if i type in electrical transmission you get over five thousand articles  
wow 
so that s a good place to start  meanwhile you can always go and talk to your subject librarian 
the person for electrical engineering is mark taylor 
his office is on level four 
will he be there now 
let me see what s the time 
twelve  fifteen heopen ll probably be on lunch or if not he ll be going at twelve thirty 
you d be best to wait and come back at two ish then you ll be more likely to catch him 
okay thank you 
this is my friend 
karl pilkington 
he is bald 
he is bald 
he has no hair 
karl pilkington 
has no hair i know they can see i ve got no hair no no 
well what do they need to know that for if they re learning a language 
bald isn t a bald a bald head isn t 
isn t that important 
teach them how to ask for bread or milk 
we ll get to that 
but this is about 
so 
friendship 
and family 
you know 
so 
it s all useful 
there s so many words you know they might as well start somewhere 
there s too many words 
a lot of words 
lots of words 
so you say it 
karl pilkington is bald 
karl pilkington 
has got a head like a fucking orange i really don t know why they need to learn this 
because they might need to say that one day but i get enough abuse now from English people i don t want Chinese suddenly turning up going bald fucking orange <now> teach them how to say milk i need milk milk for tea 
coffee 
teach me useful stuff ok we ll teach them something then 
who am i talking to 
people around the world they can t speak English yet 
so what do they i ve been to China and none of them know English 
right 
so they need to learn English 
ok so <now> 
what would they want to know 
you see they don t need to know about milk because they don t like milk 
they think english people smell of milk 
they smell 
of milk <now> 
smell 
what does smell mean karl 
smell 
<now> stink 
fucking hell you smell 
<now> rank 
rank 
rank so you ve got a chinese fella 
he s coming over here and he s learned the word 
rank meaning you stink 
smell 
stank stunk 
<now> that stunk <now> give an example 
<now> 
you smell 
you shit 
<now> why are you teaching them pidgin English because she told me you said they want to know about smell 
yeah right 
but why are you teaching them without prepositions and proper why are you teaching them to speak like this 
<now> 
stink you shit 
why are you teaching them 
to speak <now> just speak 
proper English right ok then <now> always speak proper English 
ok tell them 
<now> so what what do they want to know what what what smell mean this is ok smell so we re featuring the word smell smell 
this is about the word smell 
right when something smells they know what it means 
<now> when something 
stinks when it s off it doesn t always mean that cause it is also a verb alright a nice smell it s also a verb to smell 
it s a verb 
smell is a verb 
yes but what they ve got to remember is if they go up to someone 
and go you smell 
it s not always positive 
you would <now> you you d say you smell nice 
right but if you say you smell 
you ll get a smacknowledge in the face 
smacknowledge in the face 
smacknowledge in the face 
karl 
what s a smacknowledge in the face 
when someone thumps you thump <now> the worst english lesson ever right ok up to you <now> ok 
but what they want to like you see that s how we are focus on are we focussing on Chinese no 
well we should because 
different people want different things right 
so what would the Chinese want they come to England 
right what do they want 
why are you talking to me like I can t understand English now because I m trying to think how <now> to be clear to them 
ok 
so dropping out so forget where they come from 
wherever they re from of the world 
they all want the same things 
no but but words don t mean the same thing in certain places ther s people where it stinks in the world 
they wouldn t come to England and need to say it smells cause they re from a smellier place 
no they re not yes they are 
<now> milk let s do milk ok 
let s do milk for anyone who isn t English 
ok ok all all them ok 
we will act out 
a scenario now where you might need milk 
ok 
ok

intelligence 
of which you have none <now> where you from <now> gresham oregon <now> colonel 
what does your daddy do in gresham oregon <now> count wood chips <now> my stepfather 
and my mom run a 
convenience store 
how are convenient 
what time they open 
five a.m. 
close 
one a.m. 
hard workers 
but you were insincere bob in a much greater sense 
if we re nothing but functions here then then why don t they just send robots 
they don t send robots bob for the simple reason they haven t invented one yet 
the day comes when they can build a robot to do what we do and make it work 
then that s exactly what they ll do precisely 
but until that day 
they send us they say hey bob 
larry phil 
why don t you go on down to wichita for a couple of days 
don t worry about your room and board we ll take care of that 
and for a couple of days bob 
we lose our identities 
here in wichita 
and we become 
the hands of the company 
shaking all the other hands 
before us what you did the reason you were insincere 
is that you cut off that bond 
it would be like the hand just sort of 
breaking away from the arm and saying oh you know what i have this other thing out here to do that has nothing to do with you 
the apostle paul said please don t do that please don t do that i m trying to have conversation with you don t bring the apostle paul in i m trying to do something else i don t see how we can have a conversation like this if i m not allowed to bring up the subject of god 
we re not talking about god i m talking about something bigger than god 
bigger than god at issue bob is not your belief in god or your desire to spread that belief 
at issue is what we re here to do which is what larry which is what 
we re here to sell lubricants bob 
industrial lubricants 
we re not here to save souls 
hey do you like this classroom 
yeah its small clean and new i also like my classmates and my teacher 
i agree but i would like to have more than one teacher because i learn better that way 
so do i i dont like having assigned seats either 
i agree i dont think the teacher should assign seats to students because i like to sit with my friends 
me too i do like the classroom though 
yeah its small and pretty relaxed i like the layout too 
the layout is okay i think itd be better if all the desks faced forward and the teachers desk was at the front and corner facing the students 
well thats easier to do when there are less students 
yeah i like classrooms with few students because i feel like i learn better 
me too so what bothers you about the classroom 
well sometimes it is too hot 
i also dont like the desks they are uncomfortable 
i dont like the homework or classwork when it is too hard and i dont like the chalkboard because it is too small 
yeah if i could i would get a bigger chalkboard 
and id get some more comfortable desks 
what would make them more comfortable 
well the desks would be movable so we could sit where we wanted and they wouldnt be attached to the chairs 
if i could improve the classroom i would also make the air conditioning system better 
i think we should get more breaks from studying we spend way too much time in here 
agreed were in here at least 6 hours every day 
i wish we changed classrooms more often because i get bored easily what do you do to pass the time 
when i get bored i stare out the window for hours 
even though i get bored i still think the classroom is a good place to study because it is usually quiet 
i think its too quiet at least it is where i sit 
you sit in the front dont you you sit with all the smart kids 
yeah you sit closer to the back correct 
i do i like where i sit because i sit next to the window and the students that sit around me are nice 
even though youre in the back theyre still pretty smart and they pay attention 
we should probably pay more attention 
yeah class isnt that bad 
i agree lets go 
welcome welcome what do you think finn well feifei there are so many skyscrapers lots of tall buildings impressive arent they absolutely look at that one its gigantic oh the jin mao tower yes its pretty gigantic and this one is really enormous yes it is the oriental pearl tower is enormous and this one is absolutely ginormous gi what finn you just made that word up 
no seriously ginormous is a word it is very informal and means well gigantic 
and enormous kind of a combination of both 
gigantic 
enormous 
ginormous 
and you re right the world financial center is ginormous can we go to the top of the tower sure
