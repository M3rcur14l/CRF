anything interesting in      paper 
i want to see some exhibitions 
well there is the tate modern 
oh yes i am going to that i am meeting chang  i want to see a few things #   well you won't have much time  if you finish work at seven #  i finish early i am working from nine to one 
i see 
but i am confused though there are many places to see 
can i help you 
please 
okay what are you more interested in literature art or history #  i am interested in art and literature 
okay 
Can i make a suggestion 
yes 
the tate modern closes late on saturdays 
but   most of the other museums close around five 
so okay see here 
I suggest you take the  tube to barbican 
then you go alongside here aldersgate street and left into the museum of london 
okay  
and right next to  it is saint pauls cathedral you must see that 
it is very famous 
then you can walk across the millennium bridge  there is fantastic view of the embankment on the area around the thames brilliant old and new architecture lots happening 
i wish you could  come   too 

hi can i help you 
yes i would like to buy a washing machine 
okay which brand would you like 
i do not care so much about brands 
so what are you looking for 
i am looking for good price and good functions 
okay function and price are important to you 
that is right 
okay first may i ask you what size washer do you need 
what do you mean by what size washer 
well like a small sizes is four kilos large size is eight kilos 
do you have a medium size 
sure medium size is six kilos 
okay i think i want medium size 
alright and do you want a one bin or a two bin washer 
what is the difference between one bin and two bin 
well with the two bin washer you have to move the clothes to the spinner yourself 
and the one bin 
it does it automatically it is a two in one spin bin 
i understand which one cleans better 
they clean the same 
really and do the washers cost the same 
well the one bin washer is more expensive but it is simple to use 
simple is important well i think i would like the one bin washer 
you know if you like things simple and easy may i suggest to you the fuzzy logic function 
what is the fuzzy logic 
fuzzy logic is a special function it makes using the washer easier 
how does the function work 
well you put in your clothes you put in the soap and the washer does the rest 
sounds perfect this is exactly the kind of washing machine i have been looking for 
you sparrow aye you are familiar with that ship the black pearl i ve heard of it where does it make berth where does it make berth

waitresses do not yell at you at big boy 
hey leonard 
hi guys 
<now> hey leslie 
i did not know you ate here 
we do not this is a disturbing aberration 
leslie <now> this is penny she lives across the hall from sheldon and me 
and walks in quiet beauty like the night 
howard i have asked you not to do that 
leslie and i do research together at the university 
<now> 
wow a girl scientist 
yep come for the breasts stay for the brains 
so i am glad i ran into you the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist 
what happened to elliot wong 
he switched over to high energy radiation research had a little mishap and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him 
so are you in 
yeah sure why not 
great we rehearse on tuesdays at your place 
why at my place 
yeah department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone 
nice meeting you 
yeah you too 
leonard 
i did not know you played the cello 
yeah my parents felt that naming me leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes was not getting me beaten up enough 
if you are into music i happen to be a human beat box 
really 
i am actually not that into music 
so hey your friend is really cute anything going on with you two 
leslie 
no no what are you kidding 
he asked her out once it was an embarrassing failure 
thank you sheldon 
<now> i am sorry was that supposed to be a secret 
<now> that is too bad you guys would make a cute couple 
oh dear 
what is the matter 
she did not take my order 
how can she take your order when you are too neurotic to talk to her 
nevertheless 
this will be reflected in her tip 

well mr turner i ve changed my mind if  you spring me from this cell i swear on pain of death i shall take you to the black pearl and your bonny lass do we have an accord 
agreed agreed get me out 
hi er can you help me 
sure what s the problem 
i ve got to write an essay on electrical distribution and transmission systems but i can t find any suitable books in the engineering section on level three 
have you used the library search engine 
you mean where you type the keywords into the computer yes i ve done that a couple of books come up but they re not on the shelves someone s taken them out 
well i can put a reserve on them so that when the person brings them back to the library  ##  we can put them on one side for you ## do you want to do that 
mmm  ##  i don t know i ##  i suppose so but ideally i d like to get started on my essay sooner rather than later 
well there are some other options have ## have  you used the journal database 
no what s that 
didn t you go on a library induction tour in the first week of term they were running five days a week morning and afternoon 
no i was er i was ill that week 
well we still do two library inductions a week on wednesdays and i recommend you go on one of them  

you ll learn a lot of useful things you can sign up at the desk on level two 
yes i probably should do that then 
well i ll just quickly show you how you can use the journal database 

if you go onto the library homepage  on the computer look 

look and  click on databases here in the top right hand corner it ## it takes you to all the e journals that we have access to here at the university library 

you can use the search engine to find journals that are related to your keywords 

see   if i type in electrical transmission you get over five thousand articles  
wow 
so that s a good place to start  meanwhile you can always go and talk to your subject librarian 

the person for electrical engineering is mark taylor 

his office is on level four 
will he be there now 
let me see what s the time 

twelve  fifteen heopen ll probably be on lunch or if not he ll be going at twelve thirty 

you d be best to wait and come back at two ish then you ll be more likely to catch him 
okay thank you
