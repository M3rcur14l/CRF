is
wrong
with
you
I
won
your
bet
for
you
have
not
I
<now>
that
is
enough
for
you
<now>
I
do
not
matter
I
suppose
#
you
won
my
bet
you
presumptuous
insect
I
won
it
why
did
you
throw
the
slippers
at
me
before
#
because
I
wanted
to
smash
your
face
I
could
kill
you
selfish
brute
<now>
why
did
not
you
leave
me
where
you
picked
me
out
of
in
the
gutter
#
you
thank
god
it
is
all
over
now
you
can
throw
me
back
again
there
do
you
#
<now>
so
the
creature
is
nervous
after
all
#
<now>
#
<now>
#
<now>
#
claws
in
you
cat
how
dare
you
show
your
temper
to
me
#
sit
down
and
be
quiet
#
<now>
what
is
to
become
of
me
what
is
to
become
of
me
#
how
the
devil
do
I
know
what
is
to
become
of
you
what
does
it
matter
what
becomes
of
you
#
<now>
you
do
not
care
I
know
you
do
not
care
#
<now>
you
would
not
care
if
I
was
dead
I
am
nothing
to
you
not
as
much
as
them
slippers
#
those
slippers
#
those
slippers
#
I
did
not
think
it
meant
any
difference
now
#
<now>
why
have
you
suddenly
begun
going
on
like
this
<now>
#
may
I
ask
if
you
complain
of
your
treatment
here
#
no
#
has
anybody
behaved
badly
colonel
pickering
mrs
pearce
#
no
#
well
you
do
not
pretend
that
I
have
treated
you
badly
#
no
#
no
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
#
perhaps
you
are
tired
after
the
strain
of
the
day
#
would
you
have
#
would
you
have
a
chocolate
#
no
#
thank
you
#
well
it
is
only
natural
that
you
should
be
anguished
but
#
it
is
all
over
now
#
nothing
more
to
worry
about
#
no
nothing
more
for
you
to
worry
about
#
<now>
god
I
wish
I
was
dead
#
why
#
in
heaven
s
name
why
#
now
listen
to
me
eliza
all
this
irritation
is
purely
subjective
#
I
do
not
understand
I
am
too
ignorant
#
it
is
just
imagination
nothing
is
wrong
nobody
is
hurting
you
<now>
#
and
you
go
to
bed
and
sleep
it
off
have
a
little
cry
and
say
your
prayers
and
you
ll
feel
very
much
more
comfortable
#
I
heard
your
prayers
#
thank
god
it
is
all
over
#
well
do
not
you
thank
god
it
s
all
over
now
you
are
free
and
you
can
do
what
you
like
#
what
am
I
fit
for
what
have
you
left
me
fit
for
#
<now>
where
am
I
to
go
what
am
I
to
do
#
and
what
is
to
become
of
me
#
<now>
that
is
what
is
worrying
you
is
it
#
<now>
I
would
not
worry
about
that
if
I
were
you
I
am
sure
you
will
not
have
any
difficulty
in
settling
yourself
somewhere
or
other
#
I
did
not
quite
realize
you
were
going
away
#
<now>
you
might
marry
you
know
