hello uh 
is this the accommodation office 
yes how can I help you 
well I've got a bit of a problem 
I'm staying in the godfrey white dorm 
and on monday the warden came and told me that I have to move out this thursday 
really 
how long have you been staying at the godfrey white dorm 
for the last ten weeks 
oh have you been doing one of the summer courses here then 
yes I've been doing the academic language course since the beginning of july 
and didn't you realise that your accommodation was temporary 
no I thought I would be able to stay there for the whole year 
I didn't read the small print on the document 
the warden went through it with me and now I see my mistake 
oh dear so you're looking for somewhere to stay then 
yes 
well I'm afraid all the places in the dorms are full 
I mean there may be some students who don't show up when term starts but we won't know that for the next couple of weeks 
the best thing you can do is look for a private house 
you'll have to share with three or four other students 
meals aren't included in the price of course as they are in the university dorms 
and you'll have to contribute to the electricity bills 
where can I find out about these houses 
I've got a list here but it's not up to date 
rooms are taken up every day 
so it's hard to know whether a house has a free place or not 
I can give you a photocopy of this list and you can ring round 
can I use the phone here 
I'm afraid not 
if we let everyone who asked do that 
there'd be someone here all day 
do you have a map 
it'd be useful to know where these places are 
yes I can give you a map 
this one's got the bus routes on it too 
so you can find out how easy it is to get from the house to the university 
great 
and what if i can't find a place before thursday 
well the ymca offers cheap beds 
it's located halfway between here and the city centre 
you can get a bed in a shared room there and you can also buy cheap meals 
but you should phone up and book a bed in advance 
it's very busy this time of year 
i'll give you the number 
do you need a pen 
no 
don't worry i've got one 
so the number's four eight two five nine zero three 
four eight two five nine zero three 
that's right 
anything else I can help you with 
no that's everything thanks 
bye
